/**
 * @description
 * iOS Only. Check if the device supports iOS AppAttest.
 *
 * Attestation support is handled via an extensive system of exceptions after the service is requested. Running this function on Android will throw an error. Wrap in a platform check if you need to support both platforms.
 *
 * `AppIntegrity.isSupported()` is only exposed on iOS, but `expo-app-integrity` recommends not to use the API at all, in spite of Apple's recommendations. Apple includes the API so as not to
 * penalize users if AppAttest isn't supported on the device they're using. `AppIntegrity.isSupported()` is included in this API so that you can adopt Apple's recommended approach in your Expo
 * app if you so choose, but you'll need to have a strategy in place to determine the outcomes of unattested requests.
 *
 * Apple's recommendation for checking for AppAttest support: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/establishing_your_app_s_integrity#3576028
 *
 * Why you might not want to follow Apple's recommendation: https://swiftrocks.com/app-attest-apple-protect-ios-jailbreak
 *
 * Android has no such API, so you'll need to wrap this call in a check for an `'ios'` `Platform.OS`. On Android, whether the functionality is supported can be gleaned from simply trying to make
 * the request.`try` `AppIntegrity.attestKey` and handle API availability errors based on Google's recommendations for any error message you receive (i.e., project configuration errors, exponential
 * backoff)."

 *
 * @description
 * This is generally the only function from the module that you'll need to get an app integrity attestation from AppAttest / Google Play Integrity API.
 *
 * On iOS, this function:
 *
 * 1) Generates a key if one doesn't exist and store its identifier in secure storage as exposed in peer-dependency `expo-secure-store`. It will use the identifier
 * from the secure store if this function was already called on the user's device.
 *
 * 2) Calls `DCAppAttestService.attestKey` with your persisted key identifier and server-generated challenge to get an attestation from Apple servers. This action IS
 * subject to Apple's rate limiting, so you'll need to prepare your app with any / all of the following measures.
 *
 * - you should implement exponential backoff for failed attestation requests
 * - Onboard Users Gradually: if you already have a large user base, you'll need to incrementally introduce your attestation feature to subsets of your user base
 * - you may need to implement decision logic that is less stringent than simply rejecting unattested requests, and progressively tighten requirements if unattested traffic increases
 *
 * On Android, this function calls `GooglePlayIntegrity.requestIntegrityToken` with your server-generated challenge and project's Google Cloud Project Number to get an attestation from
 * Google Play servers.
 *
 * BOTH iOS and Android APIs are subject to rate limiting, so you'll need to prepare your app with any / all of the following measures:
 * - you should implement exponential backoff for failed attestation requests
 * - Onboard Users Gradually: if you already have a large user base, you'll need to incrementally introduce your attestation feature to subsets of your user base
 * - you may need to implement decision logic that is less stringent than simply rejecting unattested requests, and progressively tighten requirements if unattested traffic increases
 *
 * See Apple's documentation on preparing to use AppAttest for more information: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/preparing_to_use_the_app_attest_service
 * See Google's overview on using the Play Integrity API: https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/overview
 *
 * @throws
 * On iOS:
 * This function can throw errors that extend the `DCError` struct:
 * - `'INVALID_KEY'`: The key identifier is incorrect or was not provided. This is likely to be an issue with an implementation detail of `expo-app-integrity`, so file an issue on the repo if you encounter this error.
 * - `'INVALID_INPUT'`: An error code that indicates when your app provides data that isn't formatted correctly. Ensure that you're passing a valid challenge string.
 * - `'SERVER_UNAVAILABLE'`: An error that indicates a failed attempt to contact the App Attest service during an attestation. Possible resolutions include:
 *      - implementing exponential backoff for failed attestation requests,
 *      - reduce the possbility of rate-limiting by onboarding users gradually onto App Attest if you have a large user base
 *      - ensure that your users have reliable Internet connectivity with modules like `expo-network` or `react-native-netinfo`
 * - `'FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED'`: An error that indicates that the device does not support App Attest, such as MacOS. This can be mitigated by using `AppIntegrity.isSupported()` (iOS only) to check for App Attest support before calling this function.
 * - `'UNKNOWN_SYSTEM_FAILURE'`: A failure has occurred, such as the failure to generate a token. This is likely analogous to a 500 error on Apple's servers, and should be handled by implementing exponential backoff.
 *
 * `expo-app-integrity` also may throw its own `'UNHANDLED_EXCEPTION'` with the original error message if it does not match any of the above error codes.
 *
 * `DCError` struct documentation: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/dcerror
 *
 * On Android:
 * This function can throw errors that extend the `IntegrityServiceException` class:
